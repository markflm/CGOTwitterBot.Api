mysql shit

	can't figure out how to pass an array and insert it as multiple rows
	through a stored proc. pulling back much fewer rows than pointcheck, so can probably
	do a read before inserting to make sure player-team composite doesn't already exist
	without hurting performance.

	connection "pool"; necessary? helpful? tbd

	created google cloud database on mpcrav email. much higher storage if I can get it working
